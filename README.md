# scraper-extension
Springboot-ready system for reddit comments extraction stuff. Just bring your own postgres.


How to run:
- Use intellij for scraper/ folder
- Use VSCode or any IDE for extension folder (you can use the latest node version)

For extension
-  npm i
-  npm run dev

For scraper
- wait for maven to load and you can easily run, just change application.properties to its proper database environments
- (if forking, include the file on your gitignore in case of online database usage)
